###Multiple Return Values Without PBR 
---
[(TO PDF)](Vectors&Functions.pdf)

This practice problem will use everything learned in Chapter 1 and CS10A
Problem:
* Create a function:
    * Ask the user for 8 values
    * Return every value as a **boolean** that will be TRUE if the value is even, FALSE when it's odd
* Output every value's corresponding boolean
* Output "All even" if every value is even and nothing otherwise
####Optimization Notes:
* Try to keep any printing out of the functions (i.e. cout)
* Try to keep all functionality inside their functions.
* Try to keep the number of lines (of code) in main() below 13
* Try to use only 2 functions
####Notes:
* For the function:
    * How might you return multiple values from a function WITHOUT  using a pass by reference?
    * This problem can be done with just the things you've learned so far with functions and 
      vectors. Try putting them together in different ways and see the results.

You may tackle this problem however you want, but try your best to meet the
optimization notes
