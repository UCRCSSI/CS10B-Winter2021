#### Practice Problems
* **Basic** - Simple problems similar to what you see in the Zybooks pages and may see in exams
* **Moderate** - Problems that require a little more thinking. These may feel around the difficulty of challenge activities
* **Difficult** - Problems that are generally classified as Hard. These most resemble lab difficulty
* **Creative** - Problems that focus on thinking out of the box. These can vary in difficulty as the focus isn't the hardness, but rather the use of what you've learned
* **Challenging** - Problems that I generally wouldn't give during a 1 hour SI session, but are good practice. These generally require you to use and understand every aspect of the chapter
* **EXTRA** - These problems are usually slightly harder and longer than **Challenging**. They are also mostly blank slate, with barely any instructions that will walk you through the problem.
